			<h3>Reading</h3>
				<p class = "bhyp">I like to read a lot, and I mean a lot. I mainly like reading light novels but if something
				else grabs my attention I will usually dive right in. There's a <a href = "books.html">book section</a>
				included on this website with what I'm currently reading and reviews of the books I have finished. 
				These reviews are only going to include books I finish within the span of this website being up 
				because some of these titles I don't have a fresh memory for since I most likely read them years ago.</p>
			</div>
			<div class = "col-1-2">
			<h3 class = "gab">Games</h3>
				<p>I play basically the same three games over and over, with some branching out being due to friends.
				The main games I currently play are Genshin Impact, Final Fantasy 14, and Victoria II.

			<h3>Languages</h3>
				<p>For the past three or so years I've been studying Japanese and have gotten to a medium-proficientcy point.
				Since there isn't that big of a Japanese community where I live I can't dive as deep into the language as I wish
				I could.However, I have picked up Vietnamese as of early 2022 and have had a blast learning it. Those different
				tones are so much fun :').</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class = "col-1-2">
			<h3>Misc</h3>
			<p>Some other hobbies that don't need expansion upon is coding and watching videos.
			While coding is important, I think the fact I'm persuing a career in it explains everything...
			<br>
			<br>Languages I know: CSS/HTML, JavaScript, Java, C#, Python
